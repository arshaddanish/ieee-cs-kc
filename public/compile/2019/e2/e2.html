				<h2 class="text-title" align="center">Light- The technology of the future</h2>
				<div class="img">
					<img src="images/fiber-cable.jpg">
				</div>

				<p> 
					There was a time when you used to believe that light was divine and that only the sun could produce it. Humans later discovered fire which busted the fact that the sun was the sole emitter of light. In the 18t​h century, Thomas Alva Edison did a path-breaking invention- <strong>​the light bulb</strong>. ​That was not enough to change people’s notions. But that invention changed man’s perception of light and energy.
					After the invention of the alternator, producing electricity was not more a herculean task. The electricity was mainly used for lighting purpose.. It was the works of  Maxwell and Einstein that put forward the idea of using a light source to eject electrons from a metal which clearly shows that light is not that just gives us energy.<br/>
					In 1840s John Tyndall a scientist observed a phenomenon named ​<strong>Tyndall effect​</strong>, where tiny particles in a fluid  can scatter light. Later on he explained the theory of <strong>Total Internal Reflection</strong> which lead to a new device name Optical Fibre which was discovered in 1926.
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">- Optical Fibres</h4>
				<p class="answer"> 
					As the name suggests, are thin strands of silicon which transmit light. Being an EM wave, it faces no issues of external interference and is a high-speed method of communication which is replacing twisted pair cables and coaxial cables.<br/> 
					Later came a totally new concept of <strong>​Solid-State Lighting​</strong>. A light which is produced by Solid State or Semiconductor devices like <strong>​Light-emitting Diode​</strong>. This was much more efficient than traditional methods. This technology gave rise to a totally new branch of Physics named Photonics. <strong>​Photonics</strong> is a subject that deals with production, manipulation and understanding the use of light.<br/>
					Giving LEDs a boost came the invention of <strong>​LASERs</strong> in the 1960s. They are of three types- Ruby laser, Helium-Neon Laser and the Semiconductor laser. LASERs are now used in various places like biomedical, optical communication, understanding patterns of light, interference and diffraction, etc.<br/>
					Now, the solid state physics has so much improved that we have tons of devices which emit and detect light like phototransistors, LDR, photodiodes, APD, solar cell etc.

				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">- LiFi</h4>
				<p class="answer">
					The real innovation of this century is the LiFi, which is often compared to the word WiFi. LiFi is the abbreviation for Light Fidelity. ​It is more efficient, faster and more effective than the traditional methods of communication.<br/>
					As per the theory, any light source can be used for communication. But the technology we have has not been up to that mark that we can harness it directly. Now we use small models of LiFi like with an LED and an LDR through Arduino programming to learn and understand it better. The instruction which is sent from a computer is converted to binary, which is again converted to on and off of an LED. This is detected by the Light dependent resistor LDR which converts light to electronic pulses so that computer can decode them. This is basically of the system works on a small scale. For expanding this technology, we need to make it more affordable and also expand the infrastructure because, It is an undisputed fact that LiFi will march the way forward for the future of internet communication.<br/>
					There are also a lot of innovations like ​<strong>blue LED</strong> and <strong>​OLED</strong> ​which are known to be the future of photonics and the heart of the modern industry. Light is an immense source of energy. The technology can be used in a lot more ways which can exploit this resource to its full potential. We also should understand that it's we, the engineers who should strive hard to make this possible.

					<h1 class="text-title text-normal" align="center">Road to Xtreme</h1>



					<p> 
						"Road to Xtreme" is an initiative by <strong>IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter</strong> to help eager minds to conquer <strong>IEEE Xtreme</strong> - a competitive coding competition conducted by IEEE, annually.<br/>
						As a part of the Road to Xtreme initiative, we are providing various tips and blogs related to coding, so that fellow IEEE Xtreme aspirants would be able to code more efficiently.
						<br/><br/>
						<strong>Coding tips</strong> mainly consists of snippets of code which will enable the aspirant to produce more efficient codes. 
						<br/><br/>
						Another "Road to Xtreme" initiative is the <strong>Coding Blog</strong> where tips and tricks used in coding, are elucidated in the form of an article, and posted on the <strong>official Medium page</strong> of <strong>IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter</strong> - <strong>Tech bridge</strong>. 
						<br/><br/>
						Questions related to the coding tip and coding blog are hosted on <i>Hackerrank</i>, to enable the students to put into practice what they learnt through the Tips and Blogs.

					<p> 
						<strong>IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter</strong> in collaboration with IEEE LINK  (<strong>L</strong>ocal <strong>I</strong>ntegrated <strong>N</strong>etwork of IEEE in Kerala) , held an hour long webinar on 27 April, 2019  detailing the basics of IEEE Xtreme and how to go about the competition (IEEEXtreme 13.0) which is to be held in late 2019. The eminent panel of speakers consist of the Public Relations Lead and Vice Chair of the IEEEXtreme 13.0. Students from various institutions across Kerala joined the webinar session, that made it a grand success.

								<p> 
									To celebrate International women's day, <strong>Viswajyothi college of engineering and technology</strong> conducted a session for an enthusiastic and vibrant female audience, titled Ripples, which was  conducted with the help of an active volunteer from Pehia Foundation, Miss Mufeeda C K. The speaker focused on motivating the young female minds to use their creativity to explore new frontiers, and be a pioneer in their respective field. The speaker also focuses on the various activities conducted by the Pehia foundations and how, various female minds have contributed to the empowerment of women in various fields.

									Titbits is the video series released by <strong>IEEE Computer society</strong> SCT SB every month, to promote the benefits of being a computer society member. Each video explains the features provided by computer society. Two of the previous videos explained the use of E- newsletter and myComputer app. E- newsletter is the best opportunity to get the latest technology ,career development news and job trends, peer-reviewed research, and practical articles for today’s computing professionals and myComputer is an app designed to access <strong>IEEE Computer Society</strong> magazines on both Android and iOS device. Those videos helped the members to utilise their membership in a better way and the non CS members felt the importance to get their membership so that they could make use of it.
									<br/><br/>
									Titbits has been in circulation since its inception in October 2018.

									<br/>
									The idea is to bring together a developer community compromising of individuals from budding coders to industry professionals. NGOs will be called in, and tailor made projects will be initiated, that make a difference to the organization.
									<br/>
									Upon completion of the projects, the code will be open sourced. The prime motive is to bring together a set of competent people, and develop projects useful for the society and promote open source development.
