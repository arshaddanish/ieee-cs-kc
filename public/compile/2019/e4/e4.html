				<h2 class="text-title" align="center">Steps for Successful Android Application</h2>
				<div class="img">
					<img src="images/paas.jpg">
				</div>

				<p> 
					Wondered on how various android application works, curios to know how you can make? You can make your own Application in just 5 steps. <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Let the ideas flow from nature.</li>
						<li>Make Modules</li>
						<li>Choose the best Layout</li>
						<li>Share your Application</li>
						<li>Ask Others</li>
					</ul>
			</p>

				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">Nature</h4>
				<p class="answer"> 
					The Life is mired in routine and expectations. Getting into a new space places your team in a 
					mind-set to be more receptive to finding and sharing ideas. Being close to nature is energizing.
					It helps your team to be more productive in a very concentrated period of time. By breaking free
					of the routines of the office you get to better ideas, faster. According to a study in the Journal
					 of Experimental Psychology walking increases creative output by 60%. 
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">Divide and Rule</h4>
				<p class="answer">
					Modular is the process of subdividing a problem into separate sub-problem. When you have an idea,
					 first make an outline on what your product will be. Understand the problems and methods in which 
					 you will try to get your idea. Divide each problem in sub groups and repeat this process till all 
					 the problems at the base level which can’t be simplified more. 
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">Analyse </h4>
					<p class="answer">
						The most important part of your Android Application to be success is that you analyse the 
						application correctly. In android every screen you see is called activity (except few). 
						Anything you see in android like style, design etc. are called front end and those which 
						you can’t see like operations or function or calculation done when you perform an action 
						is called back-end. In short front-end is the design part and back-end is the coding part. 
						The back end is up to you, while the front-end is the one which impress the users. 
					</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">Spread the Word</h4>
				<p class="answer">
					Your Android Application will be the best among other, but it’s not useful if no one is using it. As you have 
					made the android application, everyone may not use it. A student may not use a business app, and a business man
					 need not use student app, every application is based on a group of people. Analyse your app, find bugs and 
					 error and once your application is ready, share it to those who needs to solve the problem that you have solved
					  first. 
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">Expert Advice</h4>
				<p class="answer">
					Your idea is unique but it may not be done using unique methods, others may have tried and they might have 
					more experience than you. Always Talk to Others and Explore more.

						The <strong>All Kerala Computer Society Student Convention (AKCSSC)</strong> is the annual student convention 
						conducted by <strong>IEEE Computer Society Kerala Section</strong>. This year, the host for the event was 
						<strong>St. Joseph’s College of Engineering and Technology, Palai.</strong> The theme for this year’s
						edition of the event was “Evolution of Technology”. The event aimed to instill in the
						minds of the vibrant student audience, the history of the current technology we use.
						Improvisation of existing technology by the process of unlearning in the 
						<strong>learn-unlearn-relearn cycle</strong>, to re-imagine the traditional methods of leveraging technology, 
						was the element of focus in this year’s AKCSSC. Slightly deviating from the traditional 
						technical talks, this edition of AKCSSC saw two non-technical talks on topics that support 
						and enrich the technical aspects of technology, such as content creation and women in computing.					</p>

									students get more acquainted with the <strong>C programming</strong>. In this session concepts like loops ,switches 
									and nested loops were introduced. Students did simple programs based on these concepts .This session

									C++ is by far the most popular language of choice for competitive programmers across the world as it is 
									usually faster than Java and Python, and most of the resources are available in C++. C++ also has a vast

										The idea is to bring together a developer community compromising of individuals from budding coders to industry professionals. NGOs will be called in, and tailor made projects will be initiated, that make a difference to the organization.
										<br/>
										Upon completion of the projects, the code will be open sourced. The prime motive is to bring together a set of competent people, and develop projects useful for the society and promote open source development.
