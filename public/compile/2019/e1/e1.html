				<p class="bold"> 
					The IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter was one of the recipients of the coveted “Outstanding Chapter Award” for the year 2018, globally. The Kerala Chapter has contributed to the Society and has honed its members’ repertoire through a series of events, sessions, and practices, which in turn has yielded a respectable number of REM scholars in the years leading up to this award.
				</p>


				<p> 
					Improved communication between Student Branch Chapters along with collaborative efforts of Chapters across the state – apparent from the All Kerala Computer Society Student Congress that featured a unique exposition, and consistent member development that witnessed a boost in the number of CS Chapters from 17 to 23 in 2018, are all testimonials to the best practices that were adopted.
				</p>

				<p> 
					IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter deployed a few new initiatives that indubitably aided in the holistic development of its members: A technical blog hosted on Medium platform with the publication being named as Tech Bridge was launched. The E-newsletter of IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter– Compile was released in every quarter of 2018.
					<br/><br/>
					Introduced webinars that could be attended by student and professional members alike, and conducted a Pre-Xtreme Competition at the state level to bring forth the cream coders to compete in IEEE Xtreme.
					<br/><br/>
					The website ( <a href="https://cs.ieeekerala.org/">cs.ieeekerala.org</a> )  was revamped and social media handles on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, with over a thousand followers on the former two platforms, have actively contributed to the success of events conducted and information broadcasted by the Kerala Chapter!

				<h2 class="text-title" align="center">An overview of Chatbots</h2>
				<div class="img">
					<img src="images/chatbot.jpg">
				</div>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">- What are Chatbots?</h4>
				<p class="answer"> 
					A chatbot is an AI driven software that can interact with humans in natural language. Chatbots are usually seen in websites and mobile apps.<br/>
					Advanced chatbots like Google assistant, Siri, Cortana, Bixby, etc; are commonly known as digital assistant systems.

				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">- Why should you care about Chatbots?</h4>
				<p class="answer">
					Chatbots help to streamline the interaction between customer and services, thereby boosting customer 	experience.<br/>
					After the training, testing and deployment cost of the Chatbot is met, Chatbots help in cutting down customer service cost of an organization.
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">- Technology behind Chatbots</h4>
				<p class="answer"> 
					Chatbots can be considered as an extension to a generic Question Answering system made better with the boom of big data. In its basic form, chatbots utilise a conditional “IF….ELSE IF…..ELSE” statement to compute responses from the user’s input, by searching for an appropriate answer from the data set it is provided with. Machine Learning algorithms are used to “teach” the bot regarding the type of response for a particular input, and Natural Language Processing along with semantic understanding is used to condition the chatbot to more vague inputs-the actual way that humans speak.
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">- How does a Chatbot work? </h4>
				<p class="answer"> 
					In a broad sense, a chatbot returns a response based on the input the user gives. This is however, not so easy as it seems. The chatbot identifies the user's request with proper algorithms, extracts the relevant parts of the input and gives an output. This output can be a predefined text or a combination of texts from a knowledge base. The bot should be provided with ample data sets for effective communication. There are primarily two types of chatbots: One that responds to only specific commands, and another that responds to more ambiguous inputs, made possible with NLP and machine learning as discussed above.

					<p> The event was presided by the faculty advisor of IEEE CS Chapter of the host college, the Secretary, Vice Chair and the Chair of IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter, and also the 2019 LINK team, Travancore VSAC, and the SAC of IEEE Kerala Section. Representatives, mostly the Chapter Chairs from various colleges, were informed about their responsibilities in a peer-to-peer session and were introduced to the newly elected Section volunteer team simultaneously, for correspondence in case they required help. This introductory session was followed by the annual report by the Secretary of IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter.
					<br/><br/>
					The representatives from 13 Student Branches across Kerala presented their report for the past year as well. An open discussion headed by the Chair of IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter regarding the activities of 2019 and focus points to be noted, was also held, which saw active participation from the attendees.
					<br/><br/>
					The Student Activities Chair, VSAC of Travancore Hub and the Vice Chair of IEEE Computer Society Kerala Chapter delivered their thoughts on the course of action for 2019.
