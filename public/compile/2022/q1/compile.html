    <h2 style="color: #7D0633;">ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY - TECHNOLOGY THAT CARES
    </h2>
    <div class="container">
      <img class="fed resize" src="images/at.jpg" alt=""><br>
      <p>
        The population of the world is ageing at an alarming rate. Not only has there been an increase in the number of
        elderly but also an increase in the number of elderly living alone, separated from family. This has led to the
        rise of the growing demand for specific needs that will enable the elderly to live a more content life.
        <br><br>

        Looking after people is resource-intensive. The older persons will need care services such as dressing,
        toileting or bathing: not only at care facilities but also in their own homes. Trying to remain jovial and
        unflappable whilst slowly losing the ability to look after yourself is even more challenging. But, this is a
        reality that more and more people are coming across every day leaving them despondent and frustrated.
        <br><br>

        It has been found that the use of robots and artificial intelligence in the care of the elderly might be a
        possible solution to overcome such challenges. The use of such assistive robots can make it easier for older
        people to remain self-sufficient and independent for an extended period of time, reducing the burden on their
        families or any caregivers they might have.
        <br><br>

        Assistive technology can help the elderly keep their autonomy by providing basic care and support services for
        example Telerobot monitors health conditions and medication, and Rehabilitation Robots and Therapy robots can be
        used to help older patients effectively recover from chronic strokes. Social robots have been found to improve
        mood and decrease stress levels of the elderly by providing them company and encouraging them to do cognitive
        training. They can also be used as aids in daily household chores and can also be programmed to perform basic
        maintenance activities around the person's lodgings.
        <br><br>

        Advancements in technology have enabled us to create numerous assistive technology that can cater to the needs
        and desires of the elderly. It has still been noted that the older generations are still disinclined towards
        their use of them in their day to day life. In other words, there is now innumerable assistive technology
        helping empower older people to carry out their daily routines without the need of a caretaker. It is still
        noticed that there is a gap between the technology available and the technology willing to be accepted by the
        elderly.
        <br><br>

        Whilst designing assistive technology it is important that not only the needs and desires of the elderly are met
        but their attitude towards technology at large should also be assessed. The opinions of the end-users, their
        families and their caregivers have to be taken into accordance when designing the product. For it has been
        noticed that though the elderly are more sceptical of the technology: their opinions can be swayed depending on
        their relationship with their attending physician, caregiver and family member's thoughts and beliefs.
        <br><br>

        In some cases, the assistive robots are too complex and hard to use. This will cause endless frustration and
        must be avoided at all costs .i.e the technology should not be too complex that the user will need extensive
        pre-training before using it. It also has been noticed that sometimes the technology can have excessive reliance
        on it and thus make the user unable to function without it. This can lead to self-isolation which is extremely
        bad for their mental health.
        <br><br>

        Thus, we all can come to the assertion that Assistive technology is the present and the future of the care
        industry. But, it leads one to wonder at what point will it reach for us to define basic human contact as a
        necessity and not a supplement.

        the HackerRank coding platform.
        <br><br>
        The participants were given a series of output questions and their corresponding partial code. They were then
        asked to fill in the missing code that would produce the given outputs. The top 3 participants with the
        highest score on the HackerRank platform were declared winners. The winners were Siddhartha Gautaman, Joel
        Manuel and Jowin George who got 1rst, 2nd and 3rd respectively. The competition was thoroughly enjoyed by all
        the participants.

        using HackerRank and Google Meet from 2nd February 2022 to 27th February 2022. The goal of the programme was
        to assist students to learn python, which would give them a head start in the world of programming. There were
        110 students from the First, Second and Third Year with 13 mentors to guide them. With the systematic
        orientation of the programme, Bootcamp.py turned out to be a great success.
