    </h2>

            “What we want is a machine that can learn from experience……and the possibility of letting the machine alter
            its
            own instructions provides the mechanism for this”
          </b>
        </i>
        <br><br>
        During a public lecture in London in 1947, the first concept of computer intelligence was shared by Alan Turing,
        who was later portrayed as the father of modern computer science. 75 years later, artificial intelligence and
        machine thinking have become common talk. However, we are still trying to make machines more humane, helping
        them learn to think, feel, and develop emotions the way humans do.
        <br><br>

        A new era in computing is just beginning as developers give computers ever-greater cognitive capacities. By
        handling more complex tasks autonomously, free from human biases and errors, these machines will drastically
        alter our lives.
        <br><br>

        Machines are now far better at listening, communicating, and learning, which has changed how they work with us
        and have had a big impact on our everyday lives, daily routines, and our economy. How will these machines
        improve our lives as we train them to become more sophisticated? What will set their thought processes apart
        from ours? Will these machines be able to comprehend information, ideas, and behaviours that are too complex or
        difficult for people to understand?
        <br><br>

        We define thinking as “The process of considering or reasoning about something”.
        Thinking is simply, prediction. Thinking develops to anticipate, predict, and imagine what will occur, the
        reasoning process begins with this "IF." It gives us initiative, by forcing us to imagine all possible
        scenarios. The question that arises now is whether computers can think? Are they mindlessly following a set of
        rules that the human (computer programmer) has set out for them? Or will they ever be able to upgrade themselves
        to a thinking machine?
        <br><br>

        There are several works regarding the system design of an emotional system. The current forms of AI cannot have
        their own emotions, but they can mimic emotions, such as empathy. We have in fact reached a point where
        computers understand human emotions better than ever and to a degree that many will categorize as science
        fiction.
        <br><br>

        It’s obvious that computers do not think, but they do have a function that allows them to make sense of any
        information and data attributed to them. This sounds a bit like how humans behave, but of course, with different
        states of awareness.
        <br><br>

        Thinking is not something that happens naturally in humans. There is a well-defined sequence of discrete actions
        that drive the process of thinking. Data is transmitted as electrical signals along a route between neurons when
        we are exposed to external stimuli like sight or sound. The inter-neuron connections' strength, which is the
        culmination of all prior learning experiences, determines the precise course. Numerous additional neurons may
        send messages to a neuron. If the sum of all input signals crosses its activation threshold, it transmits the
        signal to the next connection; otherwise, the signal dies at that neuron. In essence, thinking involves
        gathering information from input neurons, gradually abstracting it through several connections among those
        "thinking neurons," and finally resulting in output neurons instructing muscles.
        <br><br>

        Just as we know, all digital computers rely on a binary system of ones and zeros. They are purely based on the
        logic set out in the 1850s by the English mathematician, George Boole. A neural network's computing unit is
        referred to as a "node," and unlike densely packed neurons in three dimensions, nodes are connected to one
        another in layers: an input layer for gathering data, an output layer for producing results, and numerous
        "hidden layers" in between for processing. Each node gives the connection from an incoming node a "weight," and
        the output is the weighted sum of the data from all of the incoming nodes. The node sends its output to the
        following connected node if the weighted sum is greater than the quantitative threshold.
        <br><br>

        In light of this, we contend that machines do indeed think, although in a manner distinct from that of humans.
        Though the structure is extremely different between the human brain and the intelligent systems we design, it is
        the same. Machines are already capable of thinking, and it will only be a matter of time before they can do it
        efficiently.

          The younger generation should always be accustomed to essential technology and software in today's times. And
          what better way to ensure that than a competition. IEEE Computer Society SBC GECI conducted CL Battle, a
          sequel
          event of the Hour of Code Prerequisite Session. The competition was conducted to familiarize the students with
          Linux Shell, Compilers, Git and GitHub. And to make it even more interesting, a cash prize of Rs. 500 was
          offered. Janajith D and Adithyan P co-ordinated the whole event. The event was a command line Wargame using
          basic Linux Commands which comprised 15 levels. The event was held online, on 23rd May as an overnight event
          at
          6 pm which went on for two days. It was attended by about 42 members. After the initial stage, a few were
          shortlisted. An intense competition followed, after which the winner was declared as Robin Raj.

          The Stock Market is a means to channel the savings of individuals into productive investment. But it can prove
          to be really tricky to invest as a beginner. To provide a clear understanding of how things work in a share
          market, IEEE CS, Kerala Chapter organized a session on June 5, 2022, headed by Mr Uthraj M S, CEO and Founder
          of T - Community with 42 participants. After introducing the fundamental terms, Mr Uthraj shared his insight
          into the stock market, being a veteran of more than three years. A successful investment has a lot to do with
          being able to analyze upcoming trends, predict outcomes and trade without incurring heavy losses.
          Interpretation using candlestick charts and graphs was also explained. The participants learned about the
          investment opportunities they could pursue and were given the opportunity to join T - Community where they
          could master the tricks of the share market.

          ECE student at TKMCE, led the session.
          <br><br>
          The first session of the course, which was held just for girls, was well welcomed by the pupils. The main goal
          of the lesson was to help the participants comprehend the fundamentals of app development and the necessary
          tools. Introduction to app development and the benefits of using Flutter were discussed in the class.
          Discussion
          topics included its importance in the actual world, its popularity, and the many technologies employed.
          <br><br>
          In addition to the theoretical seminars, a demonstration of a Flutter installation was shown, and the
          attendees
          responded in kind. They were able to successfully execute it locally on their smartphone.

        IEEE Computer Society has been one of the leading bodies in IEEE in terms of membership count, participation and
        events. Joining IEEE Computer Society comes with its own benefits and there are plenty. Regardless of the year
        or branch, you are in, the IEEE Computer Society provides numerous opportunities to shine. Along with
        volunteering, the vast resources and networking one gets are truly remarkable.
        <br><br>
        To make sure the newer students knew about and engaged with the IEEE Computer Society, IEEE SB GCEK conducted an
        orientation session called Convenio on May 9, 2022, at 08:00 pm. This was mainly to get a clear idea about the
        perks of being a Computer Society member. The session was held on the Google Meet platform. It was handled by
        Sandeep E P, Membership Development Coordinator, IEEE CS Kerala Chapter. The session was an hour long and 29
        participants were present for it.
