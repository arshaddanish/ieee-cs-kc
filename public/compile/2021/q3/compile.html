      <div class="container">

        <p>
          We live in a world of technology where there are 16 billion people worldwide who actively use smartphones every day. Technology is changing a lot, the number of mobile users is constantly rising. Mobile phones were not a necessity 20 years ago. But with significant changes and rapid growth, we are experiencing immersive mediums like virtual reality and augmented reality that is informational.<br>
 
          We know how to bring the physical world into digital screens and now are primed to bring digital data and place it in the actual environment using Mixed Reality. They are a combination of AR and VR that is making its way mainstream. In fact, the mixed reality was coined around the 1990s to explore the potential of this technology.<br>
 
          Mixed reality gives us instinctual interactions with the data in the environment and among our things. Even with us not noticing, we have used this technology with our handheld devices. People may not even realize using AR filters in social media are a form of mixed reality. Not just social media, this can be used in healthcare, education, and in manufacturing.<br>
          One of the best examples to demonstrate this is Microsoft HoloLens.
          In manufacturing, such as aircraft maintenance and design validation, the tasks were accelerated by 80% and complex assembly tasks were increased by 30%. Airbus now uses Hololens to make the job easier using the actual data surrounding the environment and uses the lens to complete the task which increases worker productivity. This also increases equipment efficiency.<br>
 
          In healthcare, the lens can plan individual treatment plans for the patients that can accelerate clinical diagnosis and improve outcomes using mixed reality. Hololens can also be used to explain the procedures done using interactive 3D imagery to allay the concerns.<br>
          
          But how does it work ?<br>
 
          The details that require are very complex that host interaction between handset hardware, mixed reality software, and cloud-based servers. The handset consists of several components that include cameras and sensors to identify and respond to the problem. The hardware module works together to create a 3D hologram that will have the data values known to it before at hand. As we move through physical reality, our data is tracked and used in digital reality.<br>
 
          Imagine being able to virtually label your car keys reminding you where you left off last at home. There’s a lot more you can do with it and hence the future of Mixed Reality is forthcoming. With other technologies disrupting the current way of life, mixed reality will create more jobs. In a few years from now, we will see this mature. That will unlock a world with powerful digital information in the future.<br>

The event was initiated by Vyshnav C J of S2 CSE with the familiarization of the coding environment, basic data types, and input/output for two days. The session was then handed to Govind V R of S2 CSE for two days, who handled loops, control statements, and operators. Nikhil Krishnan of S2 CSE introduced functions and binary concepts. The next day array concepts, search, and sort were taught by Jerusha George of S2 CSE. Nikhil Krishnan later resumed the session with 2-D, character arrays, and strings. The episode came to an end on September 5, 2021, with the concept of pointers taught by Vyshnav C J.
