      <p class="para">
        Unfavorable economic circumstances, sky-high travel fares, and the impact of a tragic crash shut the book on the first chapter of commercial supersonic flight in 2003.<br>
        Since the <strong>Concordes</strong> stopped flying from 2003, air travel has doubled from <strong>1.4 billion</strong> passengers per year to <strong>4 billion</strong> passengers per year. Fueled by the technological progress we are on the
        verge of seeing a supersonic commercial airliner take flight.<br>
        U.S.-based <strong>Boom Supersonic</strong> might be the closest of several companies to deliver on the promise of a new commercial supersonic aircraft. But how close is it?<br>
        The <strong>Boom Overture</strong> is planned to provide a <strong>Mach of 2.2</strong> which is similar to the Concorde. It will take approximately <strong>3 hours</strong> to reach from New York to London. Another key issue that Booms
        supersonic is tackling, is to keep the unsustainable cost of operating the aircraft. The French and the British government designed the Concordes not for profits but to push the limits of technology. Boom on the other hand is leveraging
        scientific advancements in aerodynamics, materials, and propulsion that will enable efficient and profitable supersonic travel. This reduction in cost will impact the travelers that will reduce operating costs to turn up the profits.<br>
        The engineering landscape of aviation has seen a major facelift especially in the much more <strong>efficient afterburners</strong> used in overture and the Concorde. Due to this, the aircraft will take off through supersonic speeds without
        afterburners which was used earlier.<br>
        Besides the vast shift in technological and economical advancements, Boom is also a company looking to cut the <strong>carbon emissions</strong>. A partnership between Boom and Rolls Royce is aimed at maximizing the Overture's fuel
        efficiency, which will be sustainable and help in minimizing the noise. Boom will also be looking at carbon neutrality where the overture fleet could be running on <strong>100% sustainable alternative</strong> fuels from day one.<br>
        Boom isn’t the only company developing supersonic aircrafts. <strong>NASA</strong> has developed <strong>X-59</strong>, an experimental supersonic aircraft that lowers the noise levels of the sonic boom.<br>
        Boom's main goal is to "remove the barriers to experiencing the planet". A few more months of promising tests would kick start a new chapter in the commercial supersonic flight industry.<br>

          <strong>Founded in 1946</strong>, it has been 75 long years since <strong>IEEE Computer Society</strong> was formed as a subcommittee of IEEE. With our purpose to strive to advance the theory, practice, and application of computer and
          information processing science and technology and shall maintain a high professional standing among its members. We have come a long way to become a family of millions spanning the entire globe, all of us excited and determined to enter our
          own spark into the community.<br>
          Seventy-five years, three-quarters of a century <strong>IEEE Computer Society 75th anniversary</strong> - A time for jubilant joy. For we have made it. We are now officially celebrating our semi sesquicentennial anniversary. Found in an era
          during which the aftermath of the Second world war was still being felt where loss and despair were common and the world was a far more turbulent place. In such a world, it is almost a miracle that we survived but it's not. Because when
          passion meets cause miracles become common, they become normal. We endured, we survived and we thrived. The voice of millions, echoes each leaving a stitch in the tapestry known as IEEE Computer Society becoming leading examples for the
          Industry, research and the entire world. So that we those who have inherited their will can hold our head high and say "IEEE Computer Society is the Home for Computer Science and Engineering Leaders."<br>

          <strong>ML101</strong> was an event conducted mainly for beginners to have a start in Machine Learning. The Event which spanned 2 weeks consisted of 4 phases and a Webinar. The first phase, was mainly an introduction to
          <strong>AI/ML</strong> giving them a basic Idea about Machine Learning and Deep Learning and also the different fields It’s applicable to. In the Second Phase, the participants were introduced to an ML model (Linear Regression) and its
          python implementation was what was in focus in this phase. In Phase 3 the participants were given materials on the Mathematical Concepts of the model. During both phase 2 and phase 3 the participants were divided into groups of 5 along with
          a mentor during which they clarified their doubts and discussed the concepts. In the last phase, they were given information on the current opportunities as well as the future scopes of ML. Tests were provided during all 4 phases in the
          form of Kaggle challenges or MCQs. The whole event was concluded with a webinar on Recommendation Engines taken by Mr. Hariraj K.
