    <h2 style="color: #7D0633;">Future Games</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <img class="fed resize" src="images/future-games.jpg" alt=""><br>
      <p>
        With the onset of the pandemic and the enforced
        lockdowns, people were stuck inside their homes for days on end.
        It was a time of physical and psychological agony. When hope seemed far away and disappointment had begun to set
        in, Esports swung in and saved the world.
        <br><br>

        With thousands of passionate fans from all over the world cheering on their heroes from screens and streaming
        live on You Tube, Twitch, and other websites, Esports is played in stadiums just like any other regular sport.
        Esports delineates the world of competitive organized online gaming by recasting it into a spectator sport.
        Dota, Counter-strike, Fortnite and Call of Duty are the crowd favourites popularizing FPS, MOBA, real-time
        strategy, fighting.
        <br><br>

        The market worth 1.08 billion USD exploded showing a staggering 50% increase in value from the previous year,
        according to Statista. With an estimated 3.24 billion gamers across the globe, the sport is enjoyed by young and
        old alike, with Asia becoming the most prominent hub followed by Europe. Although esports cannot provide a
        steady income source for regular players, an average pro player can earn around $ 48,000 annually through
        streaming, sponsorships and tournaments.<br><br>

        On the horizon between imagination and reality, games are born which require high-end technology for smooth
        execution. While many video-games are designed with the best interests of the player, many others are built to
        be played professionally from the beginning. Like any other physical sport, esports also require gaming gear
        which is often quite expensive. This includes gaming laptops, keyboards, consoles, controllers, headphones,
        gaming mouses, gaming chairs and much more.
        <br><br>

        Graphics cards are the lifeblood of gaming systems. They pump out the pixels which impart life to the game. When
        it comes to choosing a graphics card for yourself, there are several factors to consider including price,
        performance and features offered. The GPU Benchmarks and Hierarchy for 2022 ranks different cards based on their
        features and performance. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 ranks first with 1400/1695 MHz Boost and 24GB GDDR6X
        Memory closely followed by Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT.<br><br>

        Many developers and publishers are rushing to become ‘the Netflix of gaming’ with Cloud gaming. Cloud gaming
        makes gaming as accessible as football or any other sport, eliminating the question of ‘equipment.’ The Cloud
        takes care of running the games smoothly rather than relying on high-spec computers or gaming consoles by
        freeing the hardware to perform optimally and is expected to grow to 7 billion USD by 2027 according to Grand
        View Research.<br><br>

        The major drawback of this technique is an ineludible stable internet connection which may not be available in
        rural areas. Internet Service Providers are working on monetizing the services used through their internet
        connection. The infrastructure and not the technology offers obstacles to the growth of esports.
        <br><br>

        According to psychologists, video games prove to be quite addicting to some people and at the same time give a
        sense of achievement to others depending on the situation. It is destructive to get addicted to games. But on
        the other hand, some games are designed to treat patients by motivating them mentally and curing depression. It
        is interesting how a game can become beneficial or malignant depending on the context of use of the game.
        <br><br>

        Regardless of the fierce competition and challenges in the field, it is possible to make your dream come true as
        a professional gamer, coach or announcer. If you aspire to make a career in competitive gaming, the Centry
        Academy of Gaming and Esports can assist you. Esports companies expect prospective employees to have the
        knowledge, skills and professionalism they are seeking. CAGE aims to offer online degrees in four esports
        specialisations: player, coach, streamer and announcer, preparing the students to survive in the mercurial
        landscape of Esports.
        <br><br>

        Unlike many conceive, Esports are as influential as any other physical sport played today. The industry has
        managed to amass a large volume of enthusiasts and continues to inspire more, spreading like a wildfire.
        Tournaments like CS:GO, League of Legends and Dota 2 are the biggest and most recognized. Esports also offers
        the opportunity to bet, watch live and play in teams or alone like in football, horse-riding or hockey.
        <br><br>

        In the era of technology boom, will Esports take over the future? There is a high probability that esports will
        overshadow traditional sports in less than a decade. It can be confidently concluded that Esports is one of the
        wisest investment choices of this decade.
