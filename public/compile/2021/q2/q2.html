        <p>
          <strong>Federated Learning</strong> is a collaborative machine learning technique which was developed by Google in 2015. Learning is performed on a shared prediction model keeping all the training  data on devices. This avoids the necessity of storing data in the cloud. Standard machine  learning approaches require centralizing the training data on one machine or in a data center.  In federated learning devices downloads, the current model improves it by learning from the  data on respective devices and then summarizes the changes taking the average of the  individual updates using a federated averaging algorithm. Only this update to the model is sent  to the cloud. All the training data remains on your device, and no individual updates are stored  in the cloud. The main advantage of federated learning is creating smarter models, lower  latency, less power consumption without compromising data privacy. As mentioned, privacy  assurance is the primary goal of developing federated learning. Since data never leaves the  premises, it is achieved to a great extent. Google keyboard is the most common example for  federated learning. However recent studies proved that federated learning's scope is not limited  to small devices but large organizations.
