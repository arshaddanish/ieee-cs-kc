				<p> 
					A familiar term to all technical enthusiasts, but most of us aren’t aware of what exactly it means. 
					Blockchain being a single term can be divided into block and chain to understand this 
					concept much better. Block stands for a data block and chain means interlink. 
					So, in short blockchain is nothing but interlinked data blocks using the technical 
					concept named cryptography. Cryptography is more familiar concept to us and it is widely
					 used to secure messages and communication platforms through <strong>encryption and decryption</strong>. 
			</p>

				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">How did it originate and what is story of technology behind it?</h4>
				<p class="answer"> 
					Blockchain was a concept created to support what we are familiar to us as Bitcoin. 
					In 1991, <strong>Stuart Haber</strong> and <strong>W. Scott Stornetta</strong> 
					had an idea to timestamp digital files and documents to prevent alterations and 
					tampering of data. They explained how it can be made using cryptography. Merkle 
					tree is a data structure which was introduced in 1992 for blockchain design. <br><br>

					A Japanese scientist <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> wrote the white paper 
					on <strong>Theory of Distributed Blockchains</strong> which is considered as one 
					of the pioneer work in this field. The paper presented the method to add blocks
					 without being required to be signed by trusted third parties which meant that blockchain 
					 will be a peer-peer transaction. <br><br>

					Each block of data has a <strong>cryptographic hash of the previous block</strong>, 
					a timestamp and data. Blockchain is claimed to be an open source and a verifiable 
					method of digital transactions. Unlike other digital transactions, blockchain is 
					peer to peer. It is also considered fool proof, and is protected against all 
					types of modifications and alteration of data. Different types of auditing and 
					monitoring transactions can be recorded and stored in a distributed time stamping server. 
					All valid transactions are hashed and stored in a tree format. <br><br>
					Depending on the access, blockchain is classified into public, private, hybrid and side chains. 
 
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">Basic terminology regarding blockchain</h4>
					<p class="answer">
						<strong>Block time </strong><br>
						It is the time taken for a network to generate a new data block in the blockchain. 
						For example for bitcoin the block time is 10 minutes and Ethereum it is 10-15 seconds.<br><br> 
						<strong>Mining </strong><br>
						Creation and adding of new data blocks to the chain is known as mining. 
						To validate each transaction, there exists a unique hash key. <br> <br> 
						<strong>Tokens</strong><br> 
						Units of value acquired through blockchain. <br> <br> 
						<strong>Shards</strong><br> 
						Splitting bigger data blocks into smaller segments also called as shards. 
						This process is also called sharding.<br><br>
					</p>
				<h4 class="text-dark-gray">Applications</h4>
					<p class="answer">
						Being a new technology less than two decades old, applications are very less but 
						these applications are marvelous.<br><br>
						<strong>Crypto currency</strong><br>
						Stands out as the most important application of blockchain. This type of digital 
						currency   eliminates the requirement of a central bank to authorize the currency.
						 Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most common forms of crypto currency and is still a 
						 controversial subject economically, politically and legally. <br><br>
						<strong>Smart contracts</strong><br>
						Contract is nothing but a legal document followed between two or more parties. With blockchain,
						 these contracts can be enforced without a human involvement. <br><br>
						<strong>Storage of digital records</strong><br>
						Now, companies and institutions can start using blockchain to store details securely. This can effectively 
						increase performance and reduce costs.
